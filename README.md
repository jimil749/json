# JSON Driver Plugin

This is an example JSON driver plugin used by the *userprovider* service in Reva. This is just an experimental repo for testing the hashicorp [go-getter](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter) package, which fetches files from external filesystems/source (Git, HTTP, Mercurial etc).
